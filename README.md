## Notes about this project

I had an older Mac laptop so I couldn't use the app store to download Xcode. Instead I used to actual website so a bunch of the 1.5 hours time that I spent on this project was due to this. I also had a bug when editing the name of the IBAction because I incorrectly deleted the action which took a lot of the time as well.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

4 of my favorite applications:
1. TikTok:
    -To watch people's livestreams, there is a button on the top left where you can scroll through all the people who are live
    -Double tapping anywhere to like a video
    -In the comment section of videos there is the most commented or liked comment that you can click at the top which will lead you to all of the related videos for that comment
2. Instagram:
    -The explore page that allows users to discover new accounts
    -The ability to change the background and theme of direct messages
    -Being able to take/share photos in direct messages
3. Twitter:
    -Instantly sharing/tweeting on your profile
    -Being able to go through tweets on the Trending page
    -Retweeting other people's posts
4. Snapchat
    -Being able to directly message someone by swiping up to their story
    -Easily going through stories
    -The simple UI that makes snapchat easily usable.

My App Plan:
I want to create an app that inspires people to make an impact in their communities. To be exact, in this app users can post pictures and videos of them attending events/taking part in activities that make a social impact like volunteering in soup kitchens and cleaning up parks. It will be similar to instagram where people can post videos of the event and activities while others can look through their stories and posts. This will be a space that only allows posts related to social impact. This can inspire others to join social impact events as well. Additionally, for those who post, they will be awarded with points depending on the activity/event. In the user's profile the points will be listed to encourage others to take part in activities. To add on, there will be another section that is dedicated to listing social impact events near the user so that through the app, they can RSVP to join activities and can also discover new activities. Finally, this app will promote becoming involved in social impact.
